# Customer Churn Data Analysis

![Project Pipeline](https://github.com/Ishankohli04/Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Customer%20churn%20analysis.png)

## Overview

This project aims to analyze customer churn using data science techniques. The dataset contains customer details and their churn status, and the goal is to identify key factors that influence churn and build predictive models to mitigate customer loss.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and evaluation
- Insights and recommendations for churn reduction
- Churn rate analysis with percentage representation
- Customer segmentation based on churn probability

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-Learn (Machine Learning)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ishankohli04/Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd Customer-Churn-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook Customer_churn_analysis.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

- Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the data and models.
- Modify parameters in the model training section to improve predictions.
- Use insights from the analysis to develop customer retention strategies.
- Visualize churn percentage among different demographics.

## Results

The project provides key insights into customer churn behavior and predictive modeling results. Visualizations and reports are generated to help businesses make data-driven decisions. The analysis highlights:

- **Overall Churn Rate:** 26.54% of customers have churned.
- **Churn by Subscription Type:** 42.71% in monthly plans, 11.27% in yearly plans.
- **Churn by Customer Age Group:** 47.68% in 18-25, 25.54% in 26-40, 11.93% in 41+.
- **Key Influencing Factors:** Customer service interaction, pricing sensitivity, and contract type.
